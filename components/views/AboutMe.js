<h2>About This Project</h2>
<p> This is my project for the SavvyCoders Jan 2022 Cohort. I wanted to build a website highlighting something that interested me. Going out to eat with friends and family is one of my favorite activities. I searched and realized that there aren't that many sites that are dedicated to providing information only about breakfast. So low and behold All About Breakfast began. </p>
