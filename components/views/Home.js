        <h2>Banana Nut Muffins</h2>

        <ul>2 cups all purpose flour</ul>
        <ul>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</ul>
        <ul>1/2 teaspoon salt</ul>
        <ul>4 overripe bananas</ul>
        <ul>1 cup brown sugar</ul>
        <ul>3/4 cup unsalted butter (melt and cool)</ul>
        <ul>2 eggs</ul>
        <ul>1 tsp vanilla extract</ul>
        <ul>1/2 cup chopped pecans</ul>

        <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and lightly butter 2 muffin tins.
In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; set aside. Mash 2 of the bananas with a fork in a small bowl so they still have a bit of texture. With an electric mixer fitted with a wire whisk, whip the remaining bananas and sugar together for 3 minutes. Add the melted butter, eggs, and vanilla and beat well, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Mix in the dry ingredients just until incorporated. Fold in the nuts and the mashed bananas. Spoon the batter into the muffin tins to fill them about halfway.
Bake until a toothpick stuck in the muffins comes out clean, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes before turning the muffins out. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
